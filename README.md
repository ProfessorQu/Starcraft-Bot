# TooManyStalkers
Did you ever think: "I wish there were more Stalkers"? Well, now there's too many!

[The github repository](https://github.com/ProfessorQu/TooManyStalkers)

Made with the [python-sc2 library](https://github.com/BurnySc2/python-sc2), maintained by [BurnsySc2](https://github.com/BurnySc2/)

## Strategy
The bot creates a Pylon close to the enemy's base,
While the bot is researching Warpgate,
It also researches +1 Weapons, Armor and Shields (later +2 and even later +3),
Then it warps in Stalkers to that Pylon,
And finally every 5 minutes it attacks,

All while breaking the other player/bot's spirit with chat messages
